# Frontend

- Instead of converting the backend response into html using RegEx, directly render the markdown and style it

## Generator

- The contact us page is still not being generated by the model (No such page present in the db, so the problem has to be with invoking the model)

### Points to be added in the SOW as per customer's requirement:
- Index/Table of Contents
- About the company
- Executive Summary
- Urgency and Impact
- Service level agreement (optional)
- A section for things not included (optional)
- RACI matrix (optional)

## SOW List

- Add a thumbnail view that displays the first slide to represent the saved document

## SOW Viewer

- The content splitter works only for the mixed, list and text type content right now, it requires an exception condition to work for table (Important)
- The downloaded PDFs currently are slightly misaligned (Crucial)
- The objective and the assumptions and constraints pages overflow

# Backend

- The db should also save the prompt given by the user for future reference or use
- The backend should accept a cover, generic, plain and signature picture or bg image upload that would be used overriding the default. This should be implemented in the generate page where the user selects the type of document to generate and then gives the user a skippable option to upload the images with a description of which parts they will be used for and then only the images uploaded by the user are then overridden for use in the template.
