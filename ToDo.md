## To add

### Generator

- Need to add a variable system that updates the request for generation in the system prompt based on the input fields used

#### Points to be added in the SOW as per customer's requirement:
- Contact information
- Index/Table of Contents
- About the company
- Executive Summary
- Urgency and Impact
- Service level agreement if any : currently partially implemented, need to accept the llm response on the condition that the user provided additional constraints

### SOW List

- Add an sow list page which displays all the SOWs generated by the user, stored in the DB

## Issues

- Tables aren't properly accounted for in the overflow logic
