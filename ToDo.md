## SOW Viewer

# Backend

- The backend should accept a cover, generic, plain and signature picture or bg image upload that would be used overriding the default. This should be implemented in the generate page where the user selects the type of document to generate and then gives the user a skippable option to upload the images with a description of which parts they will be used for and then only the images uploaded by the user are then overridden for use in the template.
