## To add

### Generator

- Need to add a variable system that updates the request for generation in the system prompt based on the input fields used

#### Points to be added in the SOW as per customer's requirement:
- Contact information
- Index/Table of Contents
- About the company
- Executive Summary
- Urgency and Impact
- Service level agreement if any : currently partially implemented, need to accept the llm response on the condition that the user provided additional constraints

## Issues
- Overflow needs to be made consistent for all pages involved
- The styling difference between the initial parts of the overflow pages
- Heading of the cover page overflows over the SOW sub-heading : the SOW sub-heading can be appended to the content generated by the model
